# ObjectTrackingBasedOnColorParticleFilter_pointCloud
Implementation of color based particle filter for object tracking, using point clouds for gesture recognition. This code only works directly with a camera (live). Based on Chapter 4 of this book: https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Kalman-Filter-Applications-Hardcover/dp/158053631X

Was implemented for this paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239732053_Real-time_Multiple_Object_Centroid_Tracking_for_Gesture_Recognition_based_on_FPGA
